Features
--------
This Javascript HTML table class allows you to:-

*	Define table headings programatically.

*	Add rows programatically.

*	Delete rows programmatically.

*	Designate a column with selection boxes that the user can use to select rows.

*	Make hidden columns.

*	Cells can contain links.

*	If you make a column sortable, and tell table the data type of that
	column (float, int, string), then the user can sort the column by
	clicking on the header.  It sorts in ascending order first, but a
	second click will sort into descending order.

*	If you make a column editable, then the user can edit cells in that
	column, and you can access the data from Javascript.

*	You can define the color scheme using CSS, including the color of
	every second row.

Documentation
-------------
There is currently no documentation.  Instead, the file
exampleTable.html demonstrates some of the features of the table and
shows how to use it.
